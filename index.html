      <h2>Valentine’s Day Toilet Paper (February 2013)</h2>

      <p>Once again my brothers have topped themselves with creative and offensive Valentine’s Day gifts for the Ryan girls. Past years have seen anatomically correct chocolate hearts and love rats instead of the traditional flower bouquets, 2013 was no different.</p>

      <h2>Snake Island Party (July 2013)</h2>

      <p>My Aunt Christy and Uncle Peter really know how to throw a party. This year marked the first time in over 10 years that I have visited my aunt and uncle at their cottage outside of Toronto. Luckily for me, they happened to be throwing a party the same weekend.</p>

      <h2>Lollapalooza with the boys (August 2013)</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Joined by my boyfriend and three brothers, Saturday of Lollapalooza was filled with fun, family, porta potties, strangers, drinks, new friends, old friends, and oh yeah, music. Our line up included: St.Lucia, Ellie Goulding, Kendrick Lamar, The Lumineers, and Mumford and Sons. </p>

      <h2>Will’s Here! (August 2013)</h2>

      <p>My new nephew William Mich finally arrived. After 9 long months of waiting, Will was born on August 6, 2013. He is the eighth grandchild in our family and we couldn’t be more excited!</p>

      <h2>Starter School (September 2013)</h2>

      <p>September was a big month. I decided to embark on a coding adventure. I quit a job that I did not enjoy and was introduced to a new contemporary way of learning that has brought me back for more in 2014.</p>

      <h2>NYC Marathon Try #2 (November 3, 2013)</h2>

      <p>While Sandy cancelled last year’s event, this year’s marathon went on with out any major issues. I cheered on five of my siblings (and a brother-in-law) who ran to raise money for melanoma research in honor of our dad. Big pasta dinners, 26.2 miles lots of smiles, and sore knees made this weekend a memorable one.</p>

      <h2> Learning to code (sort of) </h2>

      <p>I loved both learning on my own and in the first phase of Starter School. I'm nowhere near where I want to be, but what I can do now is pretty cool compared to a year ago.</p>

      <h2> Fountainhead by Ayn Rand </h2>

      <p>This is now one of my favorite books. It's a little extreme, but it really changed my perspective on people in general and how I should handle what other people say and think about me.</p>

      <h2>Lollapalooza</h2>

      <p>I flew out from New York to go with my sister, cousin, and a few friends from school. My favorites were Mumford and Sons, Matt and Kim, and 2 Chainz. It was also a productive weekend, since I interviewed for Starter School with Mike about 30 minutes before I headed over for the first show.</p>
